# Quickstart

Let's discover **Runt in less than 5 minutes**!

## Getting Started

Firstly, let's download `runt`. This can be done by using the following:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```shell
brew tap jharrilim/runt
brew install runt
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows" className="yes">

:::info

Chocolatey support not yet added

:::
<!-- 
Using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

```shell
choco install runt
``` -->

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Writing your first Runtfile

With runt installed, let's go ahead and create a Runtfile.
You may create this in any directory you like, although ideally
at the root of a project.


````md title="Runtfile" showLineNumbers
# MyProject

## Hello World

This is a hello world

```bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```
````

## Running a task

With your Runtfile now created, you may now run a task.

Let's do it!

```bash
$ runt hello-world

Hello, world!
```

Notice how the "Hello World" header was converted into
the name of the command for runt to execute. To see the
help text associated with it, run `runt --help`:

```bash
$ runt --help

Usage: runt [COMMAND]

Commands:
  hello-world  This is a hello world
  help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help   Print help
```
